        Well, Blockchain is an exceptional globally distributed ledger that
        consists of transaction details, records, and information using
        cryptography-dependent technologies. It puts forward a stable and secure
        transaction which makes hacking/alterations/modifications nearly
        impossible. In tech terms, data via blockchain is immutable.
